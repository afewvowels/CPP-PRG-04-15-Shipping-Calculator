//  The Fast Freight Shipping Company charges the following rates:
//
//  Weight of Package(in Kilograms)             Rate per 500 Miles Shipped
//  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
//  2 kg or less                                $1.10
//  Over 2 kg but not more than 6 kg            $2.20
//  Over 6 kg but not more than 10 kg           $3.70
//  Over 10 kg but not more than 20 kg          $4.80
//
//  Write a program that asks for the weight of the package and the distance it is to be
//  shipped, then displays the chrages.
//
//  Input Validation: Do not accept values of 0 or less for the weight of the package. Do
//  not accept weights of more than 20 kg (this is the maximum weight the company will
//  ship). Do not accept distances of less than 10 miles or more than 3,000 miles. These
//  are the company's minimum and maximum shipping distances.
